        The BCode team aims to build Spo-dex, a decentralized, anonymous and
        permissionless peer-to-peer music streaming platform with the support of
        blockchain and smart contracts technology. Many actors will be able to
        interact with Spo-dex and have different roles in its ecosystem: artists
        who choose to publish their music to Spo-dex will be able to upload
        songs they have composed in order for other users to stream them,
        receiving a return for every time their music is streamed. Music
        listeners on Spo-dex will instead be able to support their favourite
        artists on the platform through micro-payments which are executed every
        time the users are streamed music on Spo-dex, while being able to do it
        completely anonymously and with no need for a third party’s permission,
        thanks to the properties and capabilities blockchain technology enables.
        Users could also contribute to the ecosystem by paying (we could also
        say supporting or financing) artists to get a portion of the rights of a
        song or an album, getting in returns, in addition to the provable
        ownership of that share, also the corresponding part of associated
        loyalties. Furthermore, users will be able to become music-relayers:
        they will be responsible for correctly streaming a song requested by a
        particular user, in exchange for financial compensations. Spo-dex thus
        poses itself as a fair platform for artists, music-aficionados and
        relayers to come together and take part in a financially-incentivized
        ecosystem.
